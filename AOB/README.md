# Any Other Business



The aim of this folder is to collect sparse and almost random topics that have been discussed during the lectures and that were not intended to be in the course syllabus.

Typically, most of these topics were supposed to be preliminary for the course itself. Others are just more in-depth development of the ansers given to some questions asked during the lectures.
